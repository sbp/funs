*The picolisp of python.*

The idea is that you have lots of small python functions, using the old and now
sadly abandoned unix philosophy of "small tools that do one thing and do it
well, working together", and give them short names that are suitable for use in
constrained input environments like the shell or IRC.

In other words, these are tools for interactive python convenience.
